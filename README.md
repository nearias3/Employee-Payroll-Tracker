# Employee-Payroll-Tracker

## Description
In this app, a payroll manager is able to view and manage their employees' payroll data. This app enables a user to enter employee information, such as the first name, last name, and salary, and then view the information alphabetically on a chart. In the console, the application calculates and displays the average salary of all of the employees entered and selects a random employee from the entered data, labeling them a winner for some undisclosed prize.

The purpose of this project was for me to get better acquainted with some of the basics of Javascript. Through this refactor activity, I worked heavily with console logging and creating loops. I had to validate input, update the DOM based on data input, and prompting users based on certain criteria. I reinforced my knowledge of methods, arrays, and strings.
